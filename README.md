Hi, I'm Yazhini - actively learning something new in this ever-changing frontend world.

I am a polyglot and I always love to learn new languages be it programming or human-languages!! 

In all modesty, I speak a handful of languages in both human and machine worlds ðŸ˜‰ 

Somethings I like about myself : 

1. I voice even my silly opinions
2. Tenacity
3. Quickly learn things

I like to be around people who push me to do above and beyond. Are you one?  ðŸ˜Ž
